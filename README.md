# Iterating Squares

#### Overview
The iterating squares code is a JavaScript program that animates the movement of a square within a larger square on a web page. The inner square traverses each edge and diagonal of the outer square before returning to its initial position.

#### Files
The iterating squares code consists of an HTML file, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for functionality.
- Square.html: This file contains the structure of the web page and includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- styles.css: This file contains styles to format the appearance of the squares, including size, colors, and positioning.
- script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for animating the movement of the inner square within the outer square.

#### HTML Structure
The HTML structure includes a <div> element for the outer square and a nested <div> element for the inner square. The JavaScript code dynamically adjusts the position of the inner square to animate its movement.

#### CSS Styles
The CSS styles define the appearance of the squares, including size, colors, border styles, and positioning within the web page.

#### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code animates the movement of the inner square within the outer square. It iterates through each edge and diagonal of the outer square, updating the position of the inner square accordingly. The animation loops indefinitely, allowing the inner square to traverse all sides of the outer square.

#### Usage
To use the iterating squares code, include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your web project. Open the HTML file in a web browser, and you will see the inner square animating its movement within the outer square.

#### Customization
- You can customize the appearance of the squares by modifying the CSS styles in the styles.css file.
- You can adjust the animation speed or add additional features to the squares by modifying the JavaScript code in the script.js file.

#### Dependencies
The iterating squares code does not have any external dependencies and relies solely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for functionality.

#### Compatibility
The iterating squares code should work on most modern web browsers that support HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does not require any specific browser extensions or plugins.
